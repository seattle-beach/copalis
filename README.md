## TO DO
I'm thinking each group makes their own page, meant to showcase a small HTML/Javascript app (see examples at bottom of Readme). So they get to work in a reasonably safe sandbox, but the same actual trunk and app instance. So a bit of exposure to being on a team.

Here's what I figure is left to do:
- Create a sample mini app - I made "Adder" and "Subtractor", but we could probably be more creative/give them better examples
- Create a Concourse pipeline
- Code review, please!

Also, should we do some sort of HTML templating?

## Mini app ideas:
- Calculator
- Tic tac toe
- To-do
- Note-taking
- Pomodoro
- Book tracker - keep a list of the books you've read, the genre, and any notes
- Recipe book
- A simple game, which can make use of `onkeydown`?
- Markov chain
- Rhyming stuff
- ...
- please help!

Might be interesting to categorize these, or estimate complexity.
