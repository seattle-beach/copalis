## TO DO
- Create a sample mini app - I made "Adder" and "Subtractor", but we could probably be more creative/give them better examples
- Create a Concourse pipeline
- Code review, please!

Also, should we do some sort of HTML templating?

## Mini app ideas:
- Tic tac toe
- To-do app
- Note-taking app
- Book tracker - keep a list of the books you've read, the genre, and any notes
- A simple game, which can make use of `onkeydown`?
- ...
- please help!

Might be interesting to categorize these, or estimate complexity.
